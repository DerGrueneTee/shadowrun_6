## The future ##
This project currently switches from plain Javascript to Typescript, which means some steps back and cleanup of previous ... dirty implementations.
Unfortunately I must admit, that having this project as a side project to *Genesis* isn't giving me enough time to have a decent development pace. But I try to keep both projects in sync, so the character transfer from Genesis to Foundry VTT works for you.
